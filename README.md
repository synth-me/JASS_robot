# JASS_robot
This repository contains the final project from the FEI's (https://portal.fei.edu.br/) subject  "mobile robotics".
"JASS" stands for 'just another smart system'. It uses the well known platform 'webots' and the 'kuka robot' with one arm.
The task was: selecting an object based on the tag above it, catch and deliver it to the right position.
There's a gui to help stop and run the robot, and all the computer vision is powered by tesseract.exe
